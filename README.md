# Addon for [todo.txt](http://todotxt.org/)
This does three things:

* displays the todo list similar to `tree`. 
* displays directories and files in `$TODOTXT_PROJECTTREE_FOLDER` , as if they are projects. The default folder is `$HOME`
* filters out using the `future` filter, with additionally that it removes the t:2020-02-02 pieces. 

# installation
Just git clone it to the addon directory of todo.txt
Don't forget to allow it to be run. i.e. `chmod +x <files>`
